Development:

To get started, we'll need to get dependencies installed. 
We'll use npm (node.js Package Manager) along with bower to manage dependencies.

0. On Ubuntu, node is too old for some npm packages. We need to build it.

	$ sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
	$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
	$ sudo apt-get update
	$ sudo apt-get install nodejs

1. First install npm.

	Mac OS X:

	$ brew install npm

	Ubuntu:

	# apt-get install npm

2. Install dependencies.

	$ make

3. Make sure the h0tb0x server is up and running:

	$ h0tb0x

4. Run the end to end (e2e) tests.

	$ make e2e-test

5. Run unit tests.
   This will continue to run in the background, 
   automatically re-runs when a file is updated.

	$ make unit-test
